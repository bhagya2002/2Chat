## MyChatApp
[Ongoing]

The purpose of this project is to create a basic online messaging service while implement PHP alongside MySQL. For this project I used Apache and XAMPP to run a localhost which stored data on PHPMyAdmin.

### Languages/Tools Used
- The main compenent of the program was written in PHP and MySQL which was used to create a login system so each user can "follow" other users, view old messages (chat history), check time when the text was sent, and mark the user as "online" or "offline". User data is stored on PHPMyAdmin which consisted of login details and other information stated previously. </br>
- HTML5 was used to create the webpage and CSS3 was used to style it. </br>
- JavaScript was used to animate the various pages. </br>


### Basic Layout
+ welcome page to greet users and login/sign up </br>
+ when a user is logged into their account they are displayed their friends list on the left with a chat history on the right for the user selected </br>
- they can find a user through the find a user page
- personal settings can also be changed using the settings options

### Plans
- make it responsive </br>
- create a better user interface
